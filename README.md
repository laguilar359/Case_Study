A Case Study on Affirm, Inc.

## Overview and Origin

blue_solid_circle-white_bg (1).svg

Affirm, Inc. offers an online platform which provides point of sale installment loans to consumers [Crunchbase]. Affirm was founded in 2012 by Nathan Getings and Jeffrey Kaditz, along with with PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, who in 2014 became its CEO [Wikipedia]. 

The origin behind Affirm’s founding was to provide consumers with an alternative to the standard credit card model by using a simple interest model instead of traditional compound interests, and by providing consumers with upfront information on what they’ll expect to pay each month, with no hidden fees. Furthermore, a goal of the company was to democratize the lending process by using alternative information such as current economic conditions, eligibility criteria (credit score, payment history), and the merchant’s interest rate [Affirm.com].

Affirm is funded through venture capital rounds. To date, Affirm has raised $1.03 billion through several funding rounds [Techcrunch].

## Business Activities:

By providing easier access to personal loans, Affirm is capitalizing on the opportunity to expand lending services to markets that would typically be denied access to credit or would be subjected to predatory lending.

Affirm’s intended customers are those that have barriers to obtaining credit in the traditional model, such as “subprime” consumers currently holding 74 million credit card accounts [Creditcards.com]. Through their partnership with retail giants like Walmart, and e-commerce platforms like Shopify, among many, Affirm allows consumers to make the purchases they want without having to wait until they have available funding by taking out small loans instead of opening a line of credit. Ease of use and speed of lending decision is a decisive advantage for Affirm, as consumers are able to know within seconds if their loan request is approved, as opposed to weeks with traditional lenders. By using multiple data points to obtain personal information instead of only relying on credit score, Affirm is able to make credit available to a wider pool of consumers [Affirm.com]. 

Affirm uses Big Data, Software-Defined Security, and Machine Learning to access alternative consumer information and to make lending decisions at the point of sale. Through their use of IDOL, a proprietary tool, Affirm is able to persist across the ownership or process boundaries of their large distributed system to keep data definitions in sync [Affirm.com].



## Landscape:

Affirm, Inc. operates within the Fintech Lending and Point of Sale Loans domains of the financial industry. The biggest trends in FinTech Lending have been to simplify the lending process and to remove traditional barriers to credit worthiness. Other major Fintech lenders include Tala, Opploans, PeerIQ, and Prosper.

## Results

Affirm has partnered with around 6,000 e-commerce and traditional retailers as of 2020, and issued over $2 billion in consumer loan volume in 2018 [Pitchbook].

The core metrics of Affirm’s business model are Annual Revenue, Loan Volume, Net Present Value, and Valuation. Affirm grew 50% year over year in loan volume from 2017 to 2018, at the same time, it’s annual revenue increased from $67 million to $112 million, and grew again to $198 million in 2019 [Incfact.com]. With $198 million in revenue for 2019, Affirm significantly outpaced its closest competitors such as Upgrade ($65 million), Zmarta Group ($65 million), and Creamfinance ($27 million) [Zoominfo.com]

## Recommendations

One of the biggest threats to Affirm’s growth is public perception that it engages in the same type of predatory lending that it seeks to replace as it disrupts the traditional credit card industry. Furthermore, public concerns that the ease of access to loans could create a vicious debt trap for less financially savvy consumers, is another threat. To address these issues, Affirm should provide access to personal finance education tools to their customers within their lending ecosystem through a partnership with an e-learning platform.

By providing free personal finance education, Affirm can show that it cares about their customers and wants to help them make smart financial decisions. In order to provide access to this type of learning, Affirm would use or link with e-learning platforms. E-learning platforms are the most appropriate for this purpose because they have built-in capabilities that efficiently deliver this type of learning to consumers within the Affirm ecosystem.
